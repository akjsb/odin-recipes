        <h1> Crock Pot Chili </h1>

        <p> Hearty for when the weather turns slightly cooler, simple to put together, the hardest part
          is having patience for it to cook while the savory and spicy fragrance fills your house with mouth-watering aromas. Twenty minutes
          of preparation time, then set it for 4 hours and forget about it (or try) and you'll be
          on your way to working up your winter layer of insulation. Just kidding, this is pretty lean.
        </p>
